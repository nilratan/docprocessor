Review

Yep, 20 years late with a review. But give me a break, i was a kid back then. Anyways this movie is amazing.
 It is original, full of twists and turns, fun, funny... It deserves 9 stars. However considering the fact i had to lower 
 criteria for 'modern' movies made in the past decade, i have to give this a maxumum rating because compared to them 
 it should get 15/10 stars.
